% EXAMPLE 3
%
% In this example, a nonuniformly sampled 1D amplitude-modulated signal built from a
% white-noise carrier and an LP-random modulator is generated and demodulated by
% using the AP-Projected algorithm. The inferred modulator is then compared with the
% predefined one. This example illustrates application of the functions
% 'f_ap_demodulation' and 'f_ap_demodulation_mex' for demodulating nonuniformly
% sampled signals.
